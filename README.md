    <p class="first-line">Hello Elly, My Madam.</p>

    <p>I’m writing this message because I want to tell you something. I want you to know how much I appreciate you, and how thankful I am to have someone like you in my life. Since the day we started talking, I had no idea na magiging ganon kagaan agad yung loob ko sa’yo. I’ll be honest with you — that time, I was really questioning myself if deserve ko ba ’yon, deserve ko ba yung nangyari na ’yon, because you know what happened that time. Pero dahil sa mga sinabi mo nung gabi na ’yon, doon ko na-realize na wala naman talaga akong mali — na walang mali sa akin — sadyang ganon lang yung nangyari talaga. I was super happy noon kasi I had someone to talk to, someone who’s always willing to listen to my nonsense stories, and that’s you.</p>

    <p>Noong time rin na nag-uusap na tayo, napagod ako mag-type sa’yo, beh, haba ng convo natin noon HAHAHA — but I enjoyed every topic we had. Ang dami kong nalalaman about you, and medyo nainis ako — ay, hindi, nainis talaga ako sa mga lalaki na nakausap mo before. Nakakainis kasi bakit nila nagawa ’yon sa’yo? You really deserve to be loved ng totoo. You’re so kind, di mo deserve yung mga gano’n. Yung araw rin na ’yon, doon ko sinabi sa sarili ko na if magwo-work man itong meron sa atin, I promise to myself that I will treat you better than anyone else, lalo na yung mga past mo. If you remember yung sinabi ko na “Sakin ka na lang”, I meant it. Like, you don’t deserve that kind of treatment — you deserve to feel the love you give to them, dapat masuklian ’yon ng ganon din o higit pa.</p>

    <p>I was super happy nung nakita ko yung repost mo about me — yung I treated you well. Kasi minsan napapaisip ako if na-treat ba kita ng tama, if mas better ba ako sa mga nakausap mo noon. But I’m confident na yes — I treated you better than your past. That's why I’m so proud of myself.</p>

    <p>Now, I want to tell you that I like you. Since you came into my life, everything has felt lighter. You’ve made me see my own worth through your words, and ever since, everything’s been better because of you. I like you, Elly. I don’t know — I can’t explain. There’s a time na bigla na lang kitang naiisip, and that was when I realized na gusto na kita. It was July or last week of June, I can’t remember. Palagi naman kitang naiisip, pero nung mga araw na ’yon iba eh, kaya doon ko in-admit sa sarili ko na GUSTO KITA.</p>

    <p>Tapos noon, I used to hate the color pink kasi it reminded me of someone I used to love. But now, every time I see color pink, ikaw agad naiisip ko. Also, roses and Hello Kitty — ikaw agad naaalala ko. Kaya gusto ko mang i-deny sa sarili ko na hindi kita gusto, pero wala eh — huling-huli talaga. 😆</p>

    <p>Also, I just want to say how much I appreciate you. Every time I’m not okay, you’re always there to comfort me and listen, no matter what you’re going through yourself. You’re the person I can run to when I feel sad or need someone to talk to. You always tell me you’re proud of me, and those words mean more than you know. They make me feel stronger, even on the days when I feel like giving up. You make the hard days easier, and just knowing you’re there makes everything lighter. I’m really thankful for you, and I’ll always appreciate the way you make me feel cared for and understood.</p>

    <p>Thank you for being you. For staying, for listening, for making things feel a little less heavy. I’ll always be grateful that I have someone like you in my life—someone who makes even the quiet moments feel safe.</p>
